## Background
Video game industry is currently valued at nearly USD 200 billion with projected annual growth of 13%. It is estimated that there are close to 3 billion gamers worldwide. Steam is playing a prominent role in this industry by acting as the worldâ€™s biggest game distributor accounting for 75% the global market share. Steam offers a wide variety of games across many platforms (except, notably, mobile gaming platforms) and genres. Being the largest game distributor in the world, Steam boasts tens of thousands of games, so for someone who uses Steam as their main entry point to games, picking a new computer video game to play can be difficult.

## Project Summary
Our app is a visual explorer of video games on Steam created for casual gamers, allowing them to easily find the next game to play. In particular, our visualization dashboard allows users to easily explore, filter and compare gaming titles through several interactive and interlinked charts. The charts include a scatter plot representing individual games, bar charts that allow filtering games by genres, subgenres and modes of gameplay, and a parallel coordinates chart that displays the top 10 games for any given selection. Our dashboard also includes tooltips that provide detailed information about each game and help users orient themselves in our visualization. Overall, this dashboard provides a user-friendly and a visually engaging way to explore the data as well as to save time in the task of finding a new and exciting game to play.
